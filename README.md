### A syntax-highlighting editor written in Python. ###

I wrote this a long time ago. It was my first exploration into writing a slightly more advanced text editor. I wondered how hard it could be, and went at it. I quickly learned regular expressions were not the way to go, or at least not the way I used them. I learned a lot about GUI development with GTK, though!
